# What is gRPC?
General overview of gRPC.

  "gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment."

# What is gRPC?
Taken from https://grpc.io/

Developed by Google in 2015, here's what they aim for in gRPC:

- üí° **Simple service definition** - made with Protobuf (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
- ‚ö° **Start quickly and scale** - easy to scale.
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Works across languages and platforms** - generate code for multiple languages.
- ‚úå **Bi-directional streaming and integrated auth** - and it uses HTTP/2.0 under the hood.

---

# Where is it used?
Scenarios where gRPC is used, taken from https://grpc.io/

- Interservice communication in a microservices architecture
- Connecting mobile devices and IoT to services
- Generating efficient client libraries

Companies that adopts them:

      <li>Basically, it's sending blob via HTTP/2 for requests and responses</li>
      <li>Similar to other RPCs, it can generate stub for each languages</li>

# Pros and Cons of gRPC

Taken from https://www.capitalone.com/tech/software-engineering/grpc-framework-for-microservices-communication/

## Pros
- ‚òùÔ∏è Reduced network latency <br>
- ‚úåÔ∏è Duplex streaming <br>
- üëå Code generation
## Cons
- ‚òùÔ∏è Lack of consistent error handling <br>
- ‚úåÔ∏è Lack of support for additional content types <br>
- üëå Most browsers don't support gRPC

# Some steps to follow
Quite similar with other RPCs.

1. **Make your service definition** - achieved by using Protobuf to define your methods and service.
2. **Generate the stub** - using `protoc` and some plugins, generate the code for the required language.
3. **Implement the stub** - implement the methods generated from the stub.

---

# Protobuf Definition Example
Short sample, taken from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/

```go {all|1|3-8|10-12|14-20}
syntax = "proto3";

option go_package = "google.golang.org/grpc/examples/helloworld/helloworld";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "io.grpc.examples.helloworld";
option java_outer_classname = "HelloWorldProto";

package helloworld;

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

---

# Generate Stub from Protobuf
Generating Go code, taken from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/

This command requires `protoc` and `protoc-gen-go` to be installed.
Refer to the documentation for other languages.

```bash {all|2-3|4-5|6}
protoc \
  --go_out=. \
  --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
  --go-grpc_out=. \
  --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
  helloworld/helloworld.proto
```
